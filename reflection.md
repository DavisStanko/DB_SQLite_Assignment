Tkinter being weird on MacOS
    When a new window is made, it is made slightly lower and to the right. This becomes noticable over time.
    MacOS overides most button styling.

    None of this happens on my home PC which uses XFCE as a display manager and I suspect that this would not happen on windows either.

Git and GitHub
    This project has allowed me to become more familiar with Git and GitHub since I no longer have the ability to rely on replit's cloud sync. I have found it quite easy to use and understand through VSCodes source control panel. This is due in part to the fact that this is a solo project and I have done nothing other than push to the main branch. Creating new branches, fetching, and making pull requests seems easy enough but I've yet to have the need to try. 

    While I have been careful to commit often, on Friday I learned the hard way. I forgot to commit at the end of class and lost ~~30 minutes of progress. Luckily I realised as soon as I came home and remembered more or less how I created the 2 missing funcitons which made their recreation less painful.
