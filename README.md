# SQLite3 Assignment

This program was made to create and edit a fictional coffee shop's sqlite database. It can however, be modified for other use cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Please be sure to install the following before running the program.

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- SQLite

## Usage

Start the program by executing the main.py file.

The default password is "password" in all lowercase. There is no way to change the password other than by editing the source code. This password is essentially only for show as it is stored in plaintext and has no effect on the database itself, only the python file. Do not rely on it for security.

If you are using this program for the first time be sure to create the database before attempting to make changes to it. This can be done by clicking the topmost button titled **(Re)Create Product Table** in the main menu.

Once you have made a database, simply use the main menu to find the functions you would like to use.

## Built With

- [Product DB Skeleton](https://kprdsb.elearningontario.ca/d2l/le/lessons/20168687/topics/177979224) - Used as a starting point for the backend code.
